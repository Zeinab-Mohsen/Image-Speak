# Image Speak


For my grauation project, my team and I developed an innovative Image Caption Generator, which leverages a pretrained GPT-2 model and Vision Transformer (ViT) model to generate image captions. The main goal of the project was to explore the capabilities of AI in image understanding and provide users with a platform to generate descriptive captions for images.


### Key Features:
1. Utilized the GPT-2 model and Vision Transformer to generate coherent and accurate captions based on image input.

2. Developed a user-friendly mobile app using Flutter, allowing users to interact with the AI seamlessly.

3. Employed Flask and FastAPI to create a scalable and efficient backend that handles AI requests and responses smoothly.

4. Used Google Cloud services like Text-To-Speach API and Translate API to ensure high availability and performance.

5. Users can capture an image with the app, and it will generate a near real-time description, providing an interactive and engaging user experience.

6. Integrated a feature to convert generated captions to voice and translate them, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.
